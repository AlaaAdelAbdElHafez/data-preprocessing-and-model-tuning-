        "🌈 **Fully-connected model for sequential data**: Fully-connected models are not typically well-suited for sequential data because they don't inherently capture the temporal dependencies present in such data. For sequential data, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or their variants, like LSTMs or GRUs, are more appropriate due to their ability to process sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "🌈 **Fully-connected model for image data**: Fully-connected models can be effective for image data, especially in tasks where spatial information is less important or has been flattened into a vector representation. However, for tasks like image classification or object detection where spatial relationships are crucial, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are generally preferred because they can capture local patterns and spatial hierarchies effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "🌈 **Gradient vanishing and explosion**: Gradient vanishing and explosion refer to the phenomena where gradients in deep neural networks become very small (vanishing) or very large (explosion), making training difficult. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) are types of RNNs designed to mitigate these issues by using mechanisms such as gating units and memory cells to control the flow of gradients and information over long sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "🌈 **Multi-objective/multi-task learning**: Multi-objective or multi-task learning involves training a single model to optimize multiple objectives or perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This can lead to better generalization and efficiency by allowing the model to learn shared representations across tasks. Multi-modality learning involves learning from multiple modalities of data (e.g., text, images, audio) simultaneously. In this assignment, you might use multi-task learning to jointly train a model for multiple related tasks, and multi-modality learning if your data includes diverse types of input.\n",
        "\n",
        "🌈 **Difference among xgboost, lightgbm, and catboost**: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost are all gradient boosting algorithms commonly used for supervised learning tasks. They differ primarily in their implementation details and performance optimizations. LightGBM and CatBoost are both designed to be faster and more memory-efficient than XGBoost, with CatBoost specifically focusing on handling categorical features more effectively. Each algorithm may perform differently depending on the dataset and specific use case, so it's often beneficial to experiment with all three to determine which works best for a particular problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem Definition:**\n",
        "The problem is to predict the pricing category (beginner, plus, premium) for new Airbnb listings based on listing characteristics. Instead of providing a specific price, the model will recommend a pricing range to new hosts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input:**\n",
        "The input consists of various characteristics of the Airbnb listings in Montreal during 2019. These characteristics could include features such as location, property type, number of bedrooms, amenities, image, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output:**\n",
        "The output is the predicted pricing category for each listing: beginner (0), plus (1), or premium (2) and the type.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Mining Function:**\n",
        "Classification is required to predict the pricing category, type of the listings. Since the problem involves multi-objective and multi-modality learning, a multi-task learning approach might be employed to jointly optimize the model for multiple related tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenges:**\n",
        "- Handling diverse listing characteristics and extracting relevant features.\n",
        "- Dealing with categorical variables and encoding them appropriately for the model.\n",
        "- Ensuring the model generalizes well to new listings and different areas within Montreal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:**\n",
        "An accurate pricing recommendation system can enhance user experience for new hosts on Airbnb by providing them with guidance on pricing their listings. This can potentially increase the number of hosts and listings on the platform, benefiting both hosts and guests.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ideal Solution:**\n",
        "An ideal solution would involve a robust machine learning model trained on the dataset of Montreal Airbnb listings, utilizing multi-task learning to simultaneously predict pricing categories and potentially other related tasks. The model should be capable of handling various listing characteristics and providing accurate pricing recommendations for new hosts. Additionally, the solution should be scalable and adaptable to accommodate changes in the Airbnb marketplace over time."
